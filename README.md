# Normalizing-Flows
This Repo primarily consists of:

1.  **Implementations of the RealNVP Normalizing Flow architecture** \[[1]\]:
    *   Core affine coupling layers and model structure.
    *   Adaptations for 2D toy datasets (Moons, Circles).
    *   Multi-scale architecture for image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).
2.  **Training and Evaluation Scripts:**
    *   Scripts to train RealNVP models using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL).
    *   Scripts to evaluate generative performance via Bits Per Dimension (BPD).
3.  **Visualization Tools:**
    *   Code to generate animations visualizing the 2D data-to-latent space transformation learned by RealNVP.
    *   Code to explore the learned latent space of MNIST via interactive interpolation between digit classes.

The project aims to provide a practical understanding of normalizing flows and demonstrate their utility in analyzing complex, potentially multi-modal inverse problems.

*(Note: The INN implementations for GMM/IK mentioned in the original scope are not included in this version of the README, focusing solely on the RealNVP core and visualizations.)*

## Features

*   **RealNVP Core Implementation :** Modular code for affine coupling layers, ResNet blocks, custom BatchNorm, masking functions, and preprocessing utilities.
*   **2D RealNVP Model & Training (`2D.ipynb`):** Model tailored for 2D data with a script for training and generating visualization frames.
*   **Multi-Scale Image RealNVP Model & Training (`MNIST.ipynb`, `CIFAR-10.ipynb`):** Flexible multi-scale architecture for MNIST/CIFAR-10.
*   **2D Flow Animation :** Utilities to visualize the 2D transformation and a script to compile frames into an MP4 video.
*   **MNIST Latent Space Analysis :** Functions and a script to generate samples conditioned on digits and create interpolation videos (single pair or grid).


## Requirements

*   Python 3.11+
*   PyTorch (version 1.x or 2.x recommended)
*   Torchvision
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib
*   Scikit-learn

All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IISc-UMC-203/Normalizing-Flows.git
    cd normalizing-flows
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Consider installing ffmpeg support if video saving fails
    # pip install imageio-ffmpeg
    ```

## Dataset Setup

*   **2D Datasets:** Generated automatically by `scripts/train_realnvp_2d.py`.
*   **MNIST & CIFAR-10:** Downloaded automatically by `torchvision.datasets` via `scripts/train_realnvp_img.py` if not found in the specified `--data_dir` (default: `./data`).

## Results Summary: 

*   **RealNVP BPD:** Achieved **1.59 BPD** on MNIST and **3.78 BPD** on CIFAR-10, demonstrating successful implementation (though further training could potentially improve scores, limited by computing resources).
*   **Visualizations:** Successfully generated animations showing 2D flow dynamics and smooth semantic interpolations in MNIST's latent space.

## Note : 

This repository focuses on the implementation and understanding of RealNVP. It serves as a strong foundation before tackling more complex applications like solving inverse problems using Invertible Neural Networks.
